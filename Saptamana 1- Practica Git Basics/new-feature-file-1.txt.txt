Git (/g?t/)[7] is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.[8] It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]
