Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.
Commit. A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
